intro: |
  👋 Hello! I'm a Master's student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/csepostech/index.do#none) at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng). I am currently advised by [Prof. Eunkyung Jo](https://eunkyungjo.com/) and conduct my research in the H2CI Lab. I'm interested in how technology shapes the way we relate to the world and to one another. Through human-centered computing, I hope to design systems that genuinely support and empower the people who use them.
